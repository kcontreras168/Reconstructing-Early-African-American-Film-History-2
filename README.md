# Reconstructing-Early-African-American-Film-History-2
This project was created by UCLA students and faculty members  to reconstruct and revive the history of early African-American silent race films.  The interest for this project was sparked by the Johnson Negro Film Collection at UCLAâ€™s Young E Research Library.  Miriam Posner, Digital Humanities Director and this project's capstone professor, was informed about the collection and recognized the need to bring to this hidden film history to the foreground of academic research. The intention behind this project was to address an unwritten history, through a structure that would be the most effective for academic research.
