# Reconstructing-Early-African-American-Film-History-2
This project was created by UCLA students and faculty members  to reconstruct and revive the history of early African-American silent race films.  The interest for this project was sparked by the Johnson Negro Film Collection at UCLAâ€™s Young E Research Library.  Miriam Posner, Digital Humanities Director and this project's capstone professor, was informed about the collection and recognized the need to bring to this hidden film history to the foreground of academic research. The intention behind this project was to address an unwritten history, through a structure that would be the most effective for academic research. 

Reconstructing Early African American History Data 
Data limitations/disclaimer
Our extensive data collection process caused us to recognize the limitations of our data.  We were forced to make difficult decisions about what information to include and that information to exclude.  Further, because this history is relatively undocumented, we faced limitations with the sources we were able to utilize in our research process
